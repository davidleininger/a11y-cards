# Getting Started

This repos is the product of the talk at NYT Maker Week going over the process of building an accessible card component and using container queries.

In an effort to build this quickly I used Create React App, but need to eject to get some PostCSS plugins to work. This is certainly not production grade and as a disclaimer, it uses the same card the whole time. It was much easier than using dynamic data.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
